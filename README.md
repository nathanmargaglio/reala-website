# Reala

Greetings!  I am currently transitioning from Flask to Django (as well making rather drastic changes to the cloud services 
being utilized as well as switching frameworks in the front-end).  As a result, this project isn't in a state of being
demoed.  I will put up the a demo site as soon as possible, but until then, feel free to look through the project as is,
as it does reflect the basic functionality of the final project.
